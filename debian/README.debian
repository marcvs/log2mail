log2mail for Debian
----------------------

log2mail's configuration is in /etc/log2mail . The daemon is started via
init-script by default, logging through syslog, using the directory
/etc/log2mail/config for configuration files,  See log2mail.conf(5) and
/usr/share/doc/log2mail/Configuration for details on how this works.
